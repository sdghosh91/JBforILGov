# How to use this repository

How To Add New Folders/Files
- navigate to main JBforILGov page
- select "add file"
- where it says JBforILGov/______ , type your folder name after the / and then your file name after the next / (i.e. JBforILGov/FolderName/FileName)
- if not adding a folder, just navigate to the folder you want and select "add file"

How To Edit Codes
- select the file you want to edit
- select "edit" in the upper right corner (pencil icon)
- make your changes
- at the bottom under Commit Changes, add your description (try to be as descriptive as possible)
- if you're sure about your changes, select "commit directly to the master branch"
- if you want someone to approve your changes, select "create a new branch and start a pull request" and make a comment in the "add additional extended description" section (pull requests are basically change approvals)

Notes On Syntax/Other Things
- use present tense in Commit Changes i.e. "Update historic-actives" "Create new-SQL-code"
- make changes to your code as frequently as you want to, but it's good to update frequently in case something goes catastrophically wrong
- since we're all collaborators, we'll be able to edit other people's code. try to give a heads up before editing code that someone else is working on, or submit a pull request if someone is actively working on the code
